# mpWAV-Sound-Source-Localization
Acoustic signal processing is very useful for autonomous rescue drones in disaster situations. Sound information can be used regardless of day or night, and continuous detection is possible for a long time with a small amount of resources. This algorithm is based on a conventional correlation-based localization technique which detects the direction of a target source. This code is written in C and C++. 

This opensource is a collaboration between mpWAV and NCSOFT. Additional information about the code can be found at the URL below.
